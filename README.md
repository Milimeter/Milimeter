### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Milimeter/Milimeter** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
My name is âœ¨Oladapo Abdulrazaqâœ¨
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a social messaging application
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mobile development and cyber security
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on with customers-facing companies
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about mobile development and cyber security
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Hit me up on razaqolad300@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: My friends calls me Millimeter and i am a Mechatronics Engineering Student :). 
  To the outside world I am just an ordinary Flutter CrossPlatform Application Developer but secretly with the help of my HP computer, i fight bugs on BugBounty programs, practise Ethical hacking and i create awesome tutorial contents for the hacking community
  When i was a child i didn't have many resources to learn about Ethical Hacking so i decided to create a CrossPlatform Application to help others to learn awesome things on hacking.
  
  And i'll continue to be a better version of myself.
